# MiniMessenger
Practice project utilizing java.net, streams, and I/O


Connects a client socket to server socket. Modify the PORT_NUMBER and Server IP to that of your own. 
Messages is sent via Input and Output streams.
There are 2 seperate projects: one for the client(Main, Receiver) and one for the server(Main_Server, Server_Receiver, Server_Sender);
The client must specify the IP address of the server as well as the server port number.

Only 1 Server-Client connection at a time.

*Might have connection timeout problems when used to message from long distances.
